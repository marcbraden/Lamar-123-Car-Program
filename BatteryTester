  Goals - characterize a 12V Greenpower battery.  
             *How much charge (Coulombs, amp hours) can it pump through before it dies?
             *How long would it last in a race?
             *How does its performance change with time?
             *How can we know its state (%?) at any point during a race?
             *Know when to retire a battery.
  Apparatus:
  Current is measured with a series hall effect current sensor** with output1 to A0 (and output2 to A1 if available), and battery voltage measured across one of
  3 5k resistors in series.
  **The current sensor on the car (ACS758-ECB-050B is the one on the car) is mounted to a circuit board and includes some buffer circuitry,
  providing two outputs rather than just one.  It was calibrated in class and found to have a coefficient of 0.332 amps per unit (out of 1023).
  This value is inconsistent with the datasheet, but many users have found inconsistencies.
  The current sensor ACS770-ECB-200U is available for use as a dedicated battery tester.

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);

}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // read the analog inputs:
  int current1 = analogRead(A0);
  int current2 = analogRead(A1);
  int voltage = analogRead(A2);
  // print out the value you read:
  Serial.print(current1*0.322-166);
  Serial.print(", ");
  Serial.print(current2*0.322-166);
  Serial.print(", ");
